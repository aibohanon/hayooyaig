For whatever reason, the "Quality vs Quantity" debate gets asked every third day or so, and the answer is always quality. The problem, however, is that people often polarise the two, seeing it in black or white, and not respecting the other factors that influence the success of a video. We'll be going through one of those key factors: value  Before you read, I highly recommended this thread on " Getting More Views (https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/b1dgmy/getting_more_views_the_s.

This should be easier to do and get you even more performance, especially on Ryzen. #In-game settings Disable low power mode. This one's a big deal. If you AFK lifeskill, disable it anyway.

Days ago I made a post about proof of my battery lasting 8 hours. It was flawed and like guys all said, I'm incorrect.

Hello there online world! I need help. I noticed that whenever I go on Full Screen mode on Youtube, the screen automatically dims after the toolbar disappears. I’ve tried using other players like Netflix and Dailymotion and their Full Screen modes seem to be working normally so it looks like an isolated case for Youtube. I tried restarting my computer last night and that worked, but there has to be a solution that’s more permanent and less inconvenient than that right?? I’ve already tried. Hi everyone! After applying to med school this cycle and reflecting on the process, I found that there were times it felt a little overwhelming with the amount of information we have to know/jumps we have to go through/etc. There's a lot of really great guides out there to guide us through the process, but oftentimes it's not all gathered in one place. For the sake of convenience for future generations, I decided to compile a list of some of the things I found most helpful. Some of it comes. Today is 12 March 2050. Today is my birthday. I’m now 67 years old. My alarm clock goes off at 06:30. With a groan I wake up, and reluctantly kick away the warm, heavy bed sheets. I put my feet in the cold slippers below the bed, and shuffle to the kitchen, yawning. I pour myself a cup of hot surrogate chicory coffee (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicory). The cool morning makes me shiver, it looks like winters are getting colder each year. We heat up the house as little as possible. It's speeding up again.

Hi. This is only about halfway finished. But I haven't been playing much the past few days, so I'm going to post what I have now. Quick edit : The community has been great. Your feedback has inspired me to keep going. There's been a lot of criticism, good and bad and I appreciate every bit. To those who disagree with my statements, I hear you. I will attempt to rewrite this guide without so much subjective input. To those who have helped me with information, fret naught, I will be crediting. Recently YouTube changed their 1080p streams to make most of the rippers, savers, converters, and raw mp4 downloaders all fail on getting 1080p sources. Every one I’ve tried lately has essentially grabbed a 720p version and simply converted it to 1080p while telling me it’s grabbing the real 1080p source, including browser helpers, extensions and stand alone desktop software. Anyone else noticed this or found a good tool, online site or other workaround to extract the actual 1080p raw source.

I received my pixel 3xl yesterday morning and I've been using it ever since.

This is for a number of reasons: Hello.So ticwatch pro has a system app on it that's called Media Control.What this app does is basically control any media player currently being used by your phone.It can be youtube/spotify/system music player/video player etc. So basically i open my music player, play a song, put the phone in my pocket, and then i can change the song's and play/pause and adjust volume on my watch. BUT. A problem i encountered is that the media control only works while the phone is unlocked, or while Welcome! I’m Nathan, a 22-year-old Serial Entrepreneur. This is my story of how I grew one of my companies from zero customers to 13,800 sign ups, 3000 active users and ,000 in monthly recurring revenue in less than 90 days. ​ So just before I start here are a few facts: 1.

I want to share my journey with anxiety and the effects on my life and ask for advice about gaining my life back. This post will probably take about 10 min to read so you have been warned. 
Last week we had an awesome discussion on Runescape: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/ascvi9/universal\_lessons\_from\_runescape/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/ascvi9/universal_lessons_from_runescape/) This week I thought we would talk about the NES retro hit: Balloon Fight. This game is an incredible co-op experience. For those unfamiliar with the game, if you have a Nintendo Online subscription and a Switch, you can play it for free with the NES app. Otherwise. Greetings people, so today I wanted to talk about how I practice offline and what It means to do so, if this entire concept does not appeal to people I will promptly take that feedback and delete the thread, or if admins think this sort of thing does not belong here. Small Disclaimer: I do not encourage private servers and I will not give out links or info on how to do this, just to make that clear.

Hopefully this is a welcomed post to this new subredit. I am a sophomore high student in precalculus right now self-studying bc calc and my main source of material is Kahn Academy. (https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-limits-new) I thought a run down of the good, the bad, and the ugly of kahn academy's ap calculus bc might be helpful. Note I have not looked at their precalculus or other lower level material. Paul's Online Notes (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Calc. The following is a reflection of my frustration with award travel prompted by aksurvivorfan’s post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/8xcnaa/discussion_frustrations_with_the_act_of_churning/) on their frustration with churning. Seeing as churning and award travel go hand-in-hand, this is also a word of warning for savy churners looking to transition into the next phase that is award travel. It’s not safe to assume the same success. The process of award travel is much more difficul.
