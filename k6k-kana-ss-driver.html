Hello, Somebody asked a few days ago about a thread similar to /r/MechanicalKeyboards. I felt like this was missing indeed, but crawling through this thread made me learn a lot about mice in general. The best advice I can give you is to sit down, and crawl this subreddit for a while before you decide on a mouse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello, my current mouse is SteelSeries Kana V1, Kana was pretty OK, i used to Fingertip Grip when i was browsing PC and Internet, and while playing Dota 2 and stuff like that. In CS:GO i used both Claw and Palm, but more of the time i was using Claw Grip. Problem is after year of using the Left Click on Kana is pretty hard to click i don't really like it, tried to fix, but i don't know. I was thinking about 3 Mouses 1.SteelSeries Rival Few friends told me this mouse is gold, i have relative. Sorry in advance for this post since I know my question has been asked many times before. I've dug through all the threads I could find on the topic and none have helped so I figured I'd make one last attempt to figure this out. tl;dr Has anyone been able to successfully get the Kana v1.1 working on Windows 10? Or should I just give up and return the mouse? --- # Debugging Story I recently ordered a Kana v1.1 in white. Its the perfect mouse for me in every way - simple, comfortable 
Hello, my current mouse is SteelSeries Kana V1, Kana was pretty OK, i used to Fingertip Grip when i was browsing PC and Internet, and while playing Dota 2 and stuff like that. In FPS games i used both Claw and Palm, but more of the time i was using Claw Grip. Problem is after year of using the Left Click on Kana is pretty hard to click i don't really like it, tried to fix, but i don't know. I was thinking about 3 Mouses 1. SteelSeries Rival Few friends told me this mouse Hi guys. I just bought a Kana v2 White this evening. I plugged it in my PC and it works well/smoothly. However, as soon as I installed the SS engine, it stopped working and showed: "Driver not available. Application will exit now". I tried googling, changing USB port but it doesnt help much. Can anyone who has the same problem can help me sort this out? Thanks. I bought a kana v2, installed steelseries engine 3 and it doesn't recognize the mouse "Plug in a SteelSeries device to get started", the older versions of the drivers are alright but they don't have the options i want to use, so yeah. is kana v2 simply not supported in the ss engine. </p>
