I've been having consistent memory issues recently. After my computer has been on for a while, the idle memory usage goes up to 3-4 gb. I run out of memory programs start crashing when all I really have open are a few browser pages (maybe a twitch stream). It's getting especially bad that when I try to launch CS:GO or LoL it just straight up crashes when the game starts (not the client). Here's a userbenchmark: I do have XMP enabled, but it's still.

I tried to dual boot my PC not long after I built it a while back but I was never successful. However, I'm thinking about giving it another try. I hadn't built the PC with dual booting in mind but wanted to give it a shot anyway. I gave up on it after a few days of playing around with software and tweaking settings and whatnot. In the end I decided it was a hardware issue and left it since I didn't want to spend any additional cash on the computer at the time. I'm still not even sure if hardware.

I have 2 computers dual booting linux/Windows. I have just installed Linux mint 18 on a Lenovo and it has terribly slow internet. Through various forums I have found how to turn off power management (done) but it makes little difference. So going through the iwconfig output I found the following. Bit Rate=1 Mb/s Tx-Power=20 dBm (on the slow Lenovo) Bit Rate=57.8 Mb/s Tx-Power=20 dBm (on the fast Asus) All the rest of the output the same. Any idea why or how I can change.

Now my current problem is the internet, I am unable to connect to the internet through Ethernet, and I dont have a wifi card. The mac thinks that a dial-up is trying to be connected rather than Ethernet. and it doesn't give me a option to try and connect to the Ethernet, it has one network location called built-in serial port, and after I try and connect throu. I have a netbook (ASUS Eee PC) with Debian installed. I can manage to connect to the schools network for a short period of time, but after a random amount of time, usually 5-10 minutes or so, It loses its connection. Well, the computer says it's connected, but I can't view any websites until I either reconnect, or something. I took it to my schools IT people, but they weren't familiar with Linux. So I'm kinda stuck offline with it unless you can help me. I'll be on campus tomorrow So I put everything together and it booted up fine (yay!), but now I can't get it to connect to the internet. The lights will go on for a split second and it connects but then it loses it after a moment or two. It's been cycling like this seemingly randomly. I installed all the drivers from the CD that came with the motherboard (ASRock H97M Pro) and the LAN driver from the website to no avail. It's definitely not a problem with the internet, it's working for other computers. Is there I admit this is likely caused due to my negligence. I have a laptop that used to blue screen every now and then and I just ignored it. However after installing Windows 10 I've been having daily crashes, multiple times being common. I've tried verifying my drivers, updating them, running virus and malware scans and nothing seems to be the cause. After I installed windows 10 I wiped my hard drive in the hopes that would fix my old blue screen crash problem and as it has got worse I suspect So I updated to windows 10 and I cannot get the Ethernet adapter working. I hooked up a laptop to verify the wall jack is working fine and it is. The PC was working fine prior to the update. I tried to renew the IP address and it said that there isnt an adapter enabled to do this. The ethernet icon says limited connectivity. When I goto the adapter settings, it says not connected but still has that yellow triangle with an exclamation inside 
Updated to linux 3.19-2-1 on arch and internet would work for 2 mins and then it would stop working. I have then downgraded to 3.18-6-1 and internet works no problem. I couldn't even ping my home router. I've checked journalctl and there are no disconnect notice or errors. Ethernet (Qualcomm Atheros AR8161 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 08)) is the problem, no problems with wireless. What I have done so far: Use NetworkManager or Connman - same results Disabled ipv6 - same results Switch I've been eying this MOBO for a while. It seems good, but I've heard bad thing about the Killer Ethernet. Anyway, if you have one, how is it performing Seemingly at random, my internet stops working on Ubuntu 13.04. Specifically, wired and wireless show as connected, but I cannot reach any page using any web browser or get a ping response. I can sometimes get a few minutes of internet access when I reboot, although whether or not this happens also appears to be at random. It always disappears, although still shows as being connected, after no more than 5 minutes though. I've isolated the problem to Ubuntu itself: No issue on Windows. Hello all, First, some information: I am running ArchLinux on an laptop, an Asus N56 (a model that got released less than a year ago), which has an Intel i7, an integrated Intel video chip, and a dedicated nVidia GeForce 650m chip. Question number one: For some reason, I do not have any drivers on the Arch for the ethernet interface. I do have access to wifi, which is what I use, but if I plug an ethernet cable, it won't do anything. An ifconfig tells me that only "wlan0" and "io" is running. Screenshot ( I have a D-Link wireless card and a Linksys router. I know that the problem is not with the router because I have two other wireless devices that are connecting just fine, but my PC's connection keeps going down ever since I upgraded to Windows 7 a few weeks. I'm currently running Ubuntu 10.04 on my laptop. With the default network manager I was unable to connect to any wireless connections but the ethernet port worked fine. I then uninstalled that and installed Wicd. Now, the ethernet doesn't work, but the wireless works. Well, it works but occasionally cuts out for around 30 second every 10-30 minutes. Is there any other software I should try? Any troubleshooting I could potentially do? I'm not 100% sure where to start diagnosing this problem. Hello all, The setup: Windows10 guest with the virt-manager GUI and it's using the OVMF-UEFI with the i440FX chipset. On the host the VFIO driver is in use for both the VGA and Audio nvidia controllers. Regarding the cables: Monitor#1 HDMI2 is connected to the nvidia GPU used for the guest Monitor#1 HDMI1 is connected to the motherboard used by the host Monitor#2 VGA connected to the motherboard used by the host. The hardware:Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H97-Gaming3CPU: i7-4790 @4.000GHzGP. OK, I have this 1532 AP that the IOS got fried or corrupted on. I have been messing with this for a few hours. Found a helpful process to fix it on the cisco forums but I can't get the IOS to upload via TFTP. My main issue is that I keep getting "PERMISSION DENIED" after I enter the tar command line to get the file from the tftp server(laptop). I have all firewalls turned off, both are on the same subnet. I can watch the connection being established on the SolarWinds TFTP server Hello! I have a problem and I need a solution. :D amp#x200B; Problem: amp#x200B; I have a computer running Windows 10 with a Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 WLAN adapter. When using this computer, I've noticed my Internet speeds are roughly 1-10% of what I pay for; however, this is specifically in regards to this system on a wireless connection. All other devices in the house fully utilize my 100 Mb/s plan, LAN and WLAN. I've noticed ridiculous ping times, as well, sometimes reaching 
I had a perfectly working 10.14.3 build, but running the update to 10.14.4 has been problematic. While the system does work, I'm getting random kernel panics that make it super unstable. Now to get my laptop working with dual monitor output I had to use a Skylake spoof instead of my native Kaby Lake. I used Hackintool to originally get this all working, but now any framebuffer patch I output there I can't seem to make a bootable system. Has anyone else run into issues with this update? In Googli.
